# How It Works — Distributed Filesystems

The system operates on a client-server model where multiple nodes coordinate to provide a distributed service. Each node runs identical software but may take on different roles (leader, worker, observer).

The core mechanism involves:
1. **Discovery**: Nodes find each other through service discovery
2. **Coordination**: Nodes agree on roles and responsibilities
3. **Communication**: Nodes exchange information via network protocols
4. **Consistency**: System maintains correctness despite failures
5. **Recovery**: Automatic healing when nodes fail

This architecture provides fault tolerance, scalability, and high availability at the cost of increased complexity and network coordination.
