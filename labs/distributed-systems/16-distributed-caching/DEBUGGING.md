# Debugging — Distributed Caching

## Common Issues
1. **Race conditions**: Ensure thread-safe access to shared state
2. **Network timeouts**: Handle connection failures gracefully
3. **Resource leaks**: Close connections, release locks
4. **Configuration mismatches**: Validate configuration at startup
5. **Version conflicts**: Check compatibility between components

## Debugging Techniques
- Enable debug logging for all components
- Use distributed tracing to correlate events
- Add health check endpoints
- Monitor key metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
- Simulate failures in test environments
