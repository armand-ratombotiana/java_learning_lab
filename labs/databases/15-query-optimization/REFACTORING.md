# Refactoring: Query Optimization

## Common Refactoring Patterns

### Pattern 1: Monolithic to Distributed

**Before:** Single database handling all operations.
`java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl);
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(\"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?\");
`

**After:** Distributed with routing logic.
`java
Router router = new ConsistentHashRouter(nodes);
String target = router.getNode(userId);
Connection conn = nodeConnections.get(target);
stmt = conn.prepareStatement(\"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?\");
`

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Identify routing key and strategy
2. Create new node databases with same schema
3. Implement dual-write (write to both old and new)
4. Backfill historical data
5. Verify consistency
6. Cut over reads to new system
7. Decommission old database

### Pattern 2: Modulo to Consistent Hashing

**Before:** Simple modulo-based routing.
`java
int nodeId = key.hashCode() % numNodes;
`

**After:** Consistent hashing with virtual nodes.
`java
ConsistentHashRing ring = new ConsistentHashRing<>(vnodeCount);
String node = ring.getNode(key);
`

### Pattern 3: Client-Side to Proxy Routing

**Before:** Each application has embedded routing logic.
**After:** Centralized proxy handles routing transparently.

**Benefits:**
- Applications become database-agnostic
- Centralized routing configuration
- Easier to update routing strategy
- Better monitoring and debugging

### Pattern 4: Manual to Automatic Rebalancing

**Before:** Manual rebalancing with planned downtime.
**After:** Automatic continuous rebalancing with no downtime.

**Implementation:**
- Monitor skew factor continuously
- Trigger rebalance automatically at threshold
- Use consistent hashing for minimal data movement
- Throttle during business hours

### Code Smells to Detect
1. Hardcoded node mappings â†’ Externalize to configuration
2. Cross-node joins in queries â†’ Poor routing key choice
3. Distributed transactions everywhere â†’ Consider saga pattern
4. Manual failover procedures â†’ Automate with health checks
5. Hardcoded connection strings â†’ Use service discovery
6. Missing correlation IDs â†’ Add distributed tracing

### Refactoring Safety Checklist
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite before refactoring
- [ ] Feature flags for gradual rollout
- [ ] Shadow reads/writes for validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks before/after
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team communication plan
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Runbook for common issues
