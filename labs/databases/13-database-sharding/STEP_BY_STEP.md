# Step by Step: Database Sharding

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Understand Requirements
Before writing code, clearly define:
- Data volume and growth projections
- Query patterns and latency requirements
- Consistency and availability requirements
- Operational constraints

**Deliverable:** Requirements document with clear metrics and SLAs.

### Step 2: Design the Architecture
1. Choose routing strategy (client-side vs proxy)
2. Select distribution strategy (hash vs range)
3. Design data model and routing key
4. Plan for replication and failover
5. Define monitoring strategy

**Deliverable:** Architecture diagram and design document.

### Step 3: Set Up Development Environment
1. Java 21+ SDK
2. Maven or Gradle build system
3. Docker for local database instances
4. Testcontainers for integration tests
5. JMH for performance benchmarks

**Deliverable:** Working development environment.

### Step 4: Implement Core Routing
`java
public interface Router<K, V> {
    V route(K key);
    Map<V, List<K>> distribute(Collection<K> keys);
}

public class ConsistentHashRouter implements Router<String, String> {
    // Implementation
}
`

**Deliverable:** Working routing implementation with unit tests.

### Step 5: Add Connection Management
1. Create connection pools per node
2. Implement health checks
3. Add circuit breaker for failing nodes
4. Configure timeouts and retry policies

**Deliverable:** Connection management layer.

### Step 6: Implement Query Execution
1. Single-node query execution
2. Cross-node scatter-gather
3. Result merging and sorting
4. Error handling and retries

**Deliverable:** Query execution layer.

### Step 7: Add Monitoring and Metrics
1. Track per-node metrics
2. Calculate skew factor and health scores
3. Expose metrics via JMX
4. Set up alerting thresholds

**Deliverable:** Monitoring dashboard.

### Step 8: Implement Rebalancing
1. Monitor skew factor continuously
2. Trigger rebalance at threshold
3. Implement data migration protocol
4. Verify consistency after rebalance

**Deliverable:** Automatic rebalancing system.

### Step 9: Performance Testing
1. Latency benchmarks (P50, P99, P999)
2. Throughput benchmarks
3. Scalability tests
4. Hotspot tests

**Deliverable:** Performance report.

### Step 10: Production Deployment
1. Create deployment runbook
2. Configure monitoring and alerting
3. Set up automated failover
4. Document recovery procedures

**Deliverable:** Production-ready system.
