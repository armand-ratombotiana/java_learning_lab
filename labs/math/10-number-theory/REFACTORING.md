# Refactoring Guide: Number Theory

## Code Smells to Address

### 1. Duplicated Code
- Extracted repeated patterns into private helper methods
- Common validation logic should be centralized

### 2. Long Methods
- Break complex algorithms into well-named sub-steps
- Each method should have a single responsibility

### 3. Magic Numbers
- Named constants for tolerances, default values
- Document numerical constants with their mathematical origins

### 4. Deep Nesting
- Use guard clauses for validation
- Extract loop bodies into methods
- Prefer early returns

## Refactoring Opportunities

1. Add a Matrix class for object-oriented matrix operations
2. Implement an Iterator pattern for iterative algorithms
3. Add Builder pattern for configuring algorithm parameters
4. Use Stream API for parallel computation where applicable
5. Extract interfaces for different algorithm strategies

## Testing After Refactoring

- Run existing unit tests to verify behavior preservation
- Add tests for any new public methods
- Benchmark performance before and after
