# Internals: Number Theory Implementation Details

## Core Algorithms

### Algorithm Selection
The implementation uses the most appropriate algorithms for each operation, balancing numerical stability and performance.

### Memory Model
- Primitive arrays for core data structures
- No object overhead for numerical data
- Garbage collector handles temporary arrays

### Thread Safety
All public methods are thread-safe as they maintain no mutable state. Multiple threads can call methods concurrently.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Exception Hierarchy
- IllegalArgumentException for invalid inputs
- ArithmeticException for numerical issues
- Unchecked exceptions for programming errors

### Defensive Programming
- Check preconditions at method entry
- Validate dimensions match
- Guard against division by zero
- Handle degenerate cases

## Performance Characteristics

### Hot Paths
- Tight loops over arrays benefit from JIT optimization
- Memory allocation is the main overhead
- Method inlining helps small helper methods

### JIT Considerations
- Repeated calls are optimized by the JIT compiler
- Warm-up iterations may be needed for benchmarks
- Inline thresholds affect performance
