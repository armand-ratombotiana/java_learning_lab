# Security Considerations: Information Theory

## Security Principles

### 1. Input Validation
- Validate all input parameters before processing
- Check for null values, NaN, Infinity
- Verify dimension compatibility

### 2. Numerical Security
- Guard against overflow and underflow
- Avoid information leakage through timing
- Use constant-time comparison for sensitive data

### 3. Cryptographic Considerations
- Use SecureRandom for cryptographic applications
- Do not implement custom crypto unless necessary
- Use standard libraries (Java Cryptography Extension)

### 4. Thread Safety
- All methods are stateless and thread-safe
- No shared mutable state
- Safe for concurrent invocation

### 5. Resource Management
- No file I/O in core computation
- No network access in core classes
- Memory usage scales with input size

## Best Practices

1. Never use Math.random() for security-sensitive applications
2. Validate that cryptographic keys meet minimum size requirements
3. Use constant-time comparison for MACs and signatures
4. Clear sensitive data from memory when possible
5. Log security-relevant events (but not sensitive data)
