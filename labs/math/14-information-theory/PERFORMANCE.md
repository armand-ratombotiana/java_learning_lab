# Performance Analysis: Information Theory

## Algorithmic Complexity

### Time Complexity
- Naive implementations typically achieve polynomial time
- Optimized algorithms often reduce complexity by one or more factors
- Trade-off between time and space complexity exists for many problems

### Space Complexity
- In-place algorithms use O(1) additional space
- Recursive algorithms may use O(n) stack space
- Some algorithms require O(n²) space for matrices

### Big-O Analysis

| Operation | Naive | Optimized |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Basic computation | O(n) | O(log n) |
| Matrix operation | O(n³) | O(n^2.8) |
| Iterative method | O(k·n) | O(log k·n) |

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Algorithm Selection
Choose the right algorithm for the problem size and characteristics.

### 2. Memory Access Patterns
Use contiguous memory layouts for cache efficiency.

### 3. Parallelization
Exploit data parallelism for independent computations.

### 4. Vectorization
Use SIMD operations where applicable.

### 5. Early Termination
Stop when convergence criteria are met.

### 6. Approximation
Use approximate methods when exact solutions aren't needed.

## Benchmarking

- Measure wall-clock time for realistic inputs
- Profile memory usage and allocation patterns
- Compare against baseline implementations
- Test with various input sizes to observe scaling
- Account for JVM warm-up and JIT compilation effects

## Java-Specific Optimizations

- Use primitives instead of objects for hot paths
- Minimize allocations in tight loops
- Use final for constants and immutable state
- Consider using var handles for atomic updates
- Leverage Stream API for parallel operations on large datasets
