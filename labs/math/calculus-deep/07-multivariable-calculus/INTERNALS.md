# Internals: Multivariable Calculus Implementation

## Deep Dive into Implementation Details

### Memory Layout
The computation uses stack-allocated primitives for performance-critical sections and heap-allocated objects for larger data structures. Local variables are stored in the JVM local variable array for fast access.

### Instruction Flow
1. **Method dispatch**: Virtual method call resolution
2. **Input validation**: Bounds checking and precondition verification
3. **Normalization**: Input scaling if needed for numerical stability
4. **Core computation**: Main algorithm loop
5. **Convergence check**: Termination condition verification
6. **Result post-processing**: Error correction and refinement
7. **Return**: Value passed back to caller

### JIT Compilation Details
The JIT compiler may apply the following optimizations:
- **Inlining**: Small methods are inlined to eliminate call overhead
- **Loop unrolling**: Short loops are unrolled to reduce branching
- **Hoisting**: Loop-invariant calculations are moved outside loops
- **SIMD**: Vectorizable operations may use SIMD instructions
- **Lock elision**: Uncontended locks may be optimized away

### Garbage Collection Impact
- Temporary objects created during computation increase GC pressure
- Object pooling can reduce allocation rate in high-throughput scenarios
- Primitive collections avoid boxing overhead entirely
- Consider using off-heap memory for very large datasets
