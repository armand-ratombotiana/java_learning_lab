# Interview: Differential Equations

## Common Interview Questions

### Question 1: Conceptual Understanding
**Q**: Explain Differential Equations and why it is important in computing.
**A**: Differential Equations is a fundamental mathematical framework that enables precise analysis of quantitative relationships. It is important because it provides rigorous foundations for scientific computing, engineering analysis, and machine learning algorithms.

### Question 2: Implementation
**Q**: How would you implement Differential Equations in Java 21+?
**A**: Start with input validation, implement the core algorithm using stable numerical methods, add convergence checking for iterative approaches, and return the result with appropriate error bounds.

### Question 3: Numerical Analysis
**Q**: What numerical issues arise when computing Differential Equations?
**A**: Common issues include floating-point rounding errors, catastrophic cancellation when subtracting nearly equal numbers, and ill-conditioned inputs that amplify errors.

### Question 4: Performance
**Q**: How would you optimize Differential Equations computation for large inputs?
**A**: Consider algorithmic improvements (better asymptotics), parallel processing with streams or ForkJoinPool, memory optimization (pre-allocation, cache-friendly access), and JVM tuning.

### Question 5: System Design
**Q**: Design a system for computing Differential Equations at scale.
**A**: Discuss API design with clean separation of concerns, concurrency model (thread pools, actors), error handling strategy, monitoring and alerting, and deployment considerations.

## Coding Challenge

### Problem
Implement an efficient, numerically stable version of the core Differential Equations algorithm.

`java
public class CodingChallenge {
    public static double compute(double[] values) {
        // O(n) time, O(1) space
        // Handle null, empty, NaN edge cases
        // Use numerically stable formulation
        return 0.0;
    }
}
`
