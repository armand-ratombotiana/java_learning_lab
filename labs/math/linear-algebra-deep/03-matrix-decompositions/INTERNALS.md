# Internals: Matrix Decompositions Implementation

## Deep Dive into Implementation Details

### Memory Layout
Stack-allocated primitives for performance-critical sections, heap objects for larger structures.

### Instruction Flow
1. Method dispatch
2. Input validation
3. Normalization
4. Core computation loop
5. Convergence check
6. Result post-processing
7. Return

### JIT Compilation
The JIT compiler may apply inlining, loop unrolling, hoisting, and SIMD vectorization.

### Garbage Collection Impact
- Temporary objects increase GC pressure
- Object pooling reduces allocation rate
- Primitive collections avoid boxing

## Internals Checklist
- [ ] Memory access pattern analyzed
- [ ] Hot paths identified for optimization
- [ ] GC impact measured
- [ ] Thread safety verified
