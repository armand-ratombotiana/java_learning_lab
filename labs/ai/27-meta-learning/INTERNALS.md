# Internal Implementation: Meta-Learning

## 1. Core Engine
The computational engine manages a directed acyclic graph of operations. Each node is an operation, edges represent data dependencies. The engine schedules operations for efficient execution considering dependencies and available resources.

## 2. Memory Management
- Tensor pooling reduces allocation overhead
- Reference counting enables automatic cleanup
- Lazy evaluation defers computation until needed
- Gradient checkpointing trades compute for memory

## 3. Computation Graph
Operations are organized as nodes in a computation graph. Forward pass traverses forward; backward pass traverses in reverse applying chain rule. The graph enables automatic differentiation.

## 4. Parallel Execution
Independent operations can execute in parallel using fork-join parallelism. The scheduler identifies independent subgraphs and dispatches them to available threads.

## 5. Serialization
Models are serialized to binary format with versioning, checksums, and optional compression. The format supports forward compatibility for model deployment.
