# Refactoring: Multi-Task Learning

## 1. Why Refactor
Improves code quality, maintainability, and testability without changing behavior. Reduces technical debt and makes debugging easier.

## 2. Common Code Smells
- Long methods with multiple responsibilities
- Large classes violating single responsibility
- Duplicated code across implementations
- Tight coupling between components

## 3. Refactoring Techniques
- Extract Method: Break long methods into focused ones
- Extract Class: Split large classes by responsibility
- Introduce Interface: Define contracts between components
- Replace Conditional with Polymorphism: Use strategy pattern

## 4. Process
1. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Run tests after each change
4. Code review all refactoring changes

## 5. Benefits
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better separation of concerns
- More reusable components
