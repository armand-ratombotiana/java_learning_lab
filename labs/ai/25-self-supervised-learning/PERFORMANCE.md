# Performance: Self-Supervised Learning

## 1. Performance Metrics
Key metrics include throughput (samples/sec), latency (ms per prediction), memory usage, and GPU utilization.

## 2. Computational Optimization
- Vectorization and SIMD operations
- Cache-friendly memory layouts
- Operation fusion (combining adjacent operations)
- Just-in-time compilation optimizations

## 3. Memory Optimization
- In-place operations to reduce allocation
- Memory pooling and reuse
- Gradient checkpointing for memory-constrained training
- Mixed precision (FP16/BF16) for throughput

## 4. Parallelism
- Data parallelism: Split data across devices
- Model parallelism: Split model across devices
- Pipeline parallelism: Overlap computation stages

## 5. Benchmarking
Always benchmark with representative data and hardware. Report mean and variance across multiple runs. Profile to identify bottlenecks before optimizing.
