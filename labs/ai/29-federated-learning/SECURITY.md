# Security: Federated Learning

## 1. Threat Overview
Security concerns in Federated Learning include adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model theft, and privacy violations. Understanding these threats is essential for building robust systems.

## 2. Adversarial Attacks
Adversarial examples are inputs crafted to cause misclassification. Defenses include adversarial training, input sanitization, and gradient masking.

## 3. Data Security
- Training data must be protected from unauthorized access
- Data lineage should be tracked for auditing
- Differential privacy provides mathematical privacy guarantees

## 4. Model Security
- Model extraction: Limit API access and add perturbations
- Model theft: Use watermarking and encryption
- Integrity: Sign and verify model checkpoints

## 5. Best Practices
1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Rate limiting for inference APIs
3. Encryption at rest and in transit
4. Access control and authentication
5. Regular security audits
6. Monitoring for anomalous behavior
