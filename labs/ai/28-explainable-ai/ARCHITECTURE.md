# Explainable AI System Architecture

## 1. High-Level Architecture
The Explainable AI system follows a layered architecture: Data Layer â†’ Model Layer â†’ Training Layer â†’ Evaluation Layer. Each layer has well-defined responsibilities and communicates through interfaces.

## 2. Component Design

### 2.1 Data Layer
- DataLoader: Streams data from various sources
- Preprocessor: Applies transformations and normalization
- BatchGenerator: Creates mini-batches for training
- Augmenter: Generates augmented training examples

### 2.2 Model Layer
- Model: Encapsulates the algorithm with forward and backward passes
- Layer: Building blocks (dense, convolutional, attention)
- Activation: Non-linear functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)
- Loss: Objective functions (MSE, cross-entropy, hinge)

### 2.3 Training Layer
- Trainer: Orchestrates the training loop
- Optimizer: Parameter update rules (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)
- Scheduler: Learning rate adjustment over time
- Checkpointer: Saves and loads model states

### 2.4 Evaluation Layer
- Metric: Performance measures (accuracy, F1, AUC)
- Validator: Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Reporter: Generates evaluation reports and visualizations

## 3. Data Flow
1. Raw data enters the Data Layer for preprocessing
2. Preprocessed batches flow to the Model Layer for forward pass
3. Loss computation triggers backward pass
4. Gradients flow to the Training Layer for parameter updates
5. Trained model evaluated in the Evaluation Layer

## 4. Design Patterns
- Strategy: Interchangeable algorithms and optimizers
- Builder: Fluent configuration of complex models
- Factory: Runtime component creation
- Observer: Monitoring and logging events

## 5. Deployment Architecture
- Training: Batch processing infrastructure with parallel workers
- Inference: REST API endpoints for real-time predictions
- Monitoring: Metrics collection, alerting, and dashboard
- Versioning: Model registry with version management
