# Step-by-Step Tutorial

## Step 1: Project Setup

Create a new Maven project:
`xml
<project>
    <groupId>com.javaacademy</groupId>
    <artifactId>34-logging-lab</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>21</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>21</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
</project>
`

## Step 2: Define Core Interfaces

Start by defining the contracts between components. Interfaces define what each component does without specifying how.

## Step 3: Implement the Core Logic

Create concrete implementations of your interfaces. Follow the single responsibility principle — each class should have one clear purpose.

## Step 4: Write Unit Tests

Test each component in isolation using mocked dependencies. Verify both success paths and error conditions.

## Step 5: Add Error Handling

Handle exceptions appropriately at each layer. Log meaningful context with each error. Fail fast at system boundaries.

## Step 6: Integration

Wire all components together using dependency injection. Configure external connections. Verify the system works end-to-end.

## Step 7: Monitor and Optimize

Add metrics and structured logging. Profile to identify bottlenecks. Apply targeted optimizations based on data.

## Common Workflow

Design -> Implement -> Test -> Integrate -> Optimize -> Deploy
