# Reactive Programming — Math Foundation

## Mathematical Concepts

### Complexity Analysis

Understanding Big-O notation is essential for evaluating Reactive Programming performance:

| Notation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| O(1) | Constant | Fixed time regardless of input size |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Time grows slowly with input |
| O(n) | Linear | Time grows proportionally to input |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Common for efficient sorting |
| O(n^2) | Quadratic | Nested iterations |

### Set Theory

Collections and data structures in Reactive Programming are based on mathematical set theory:
- Union (A ∪ B): Combine elements from both sets
- Intersection (A ∩ B): Elements common to both sets
- Difference (A \ B): Elements in A but not in B
- Subset (A ⊆ B): All elements of A are in B

### Probability Fundamentals

Essential for understanding randomized algorithms:
- Expected value: Sum of outcomes weighted by probabilities
- Variance: Measure of spread around expected value
- Standard deviation: Square root of variance

### Graph Theory

Relevant for dependency management:
- Nodes represent components
- Edges represent dependencies
- Cycles indicate circular dependencies (problematic)
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) represents clean dependency hierarchy

## Practical Applications

### Memory Calculation

`
Object memory = header (12-16 bytes) + instance fields + padding
Array memory = header + length * element size + padding
`

### Time Complexity

When choosing between Reactive Programming approaches, consider:
1. Time complexity — how does execution time scale with input?
2. Space complexity — how does memory usage scale?
3. Trade-offs — time vs space, consistency vs availability

These mathematical foundations help you make informed decisions when applying Reactive Programming concepts.
