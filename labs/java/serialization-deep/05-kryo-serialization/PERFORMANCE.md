# Kryo Serialization -- Performance

## Performance Characteristics

### 1. Throughput Metrics
Serialization throughput depends on multiple factors:
- Object graph complexity (depth, width, connectivity)
- Field types (primitives serialize faster than objects)
- String sizes and count
- Collection sizes and nesting level
- Reference density (shared objects add overhead)

### 2. Memory Usage Breakdown
- Output buffer: temporary storage during serialization
- Handle table: references for object tracking
- Class descriptor cache: type metadata (amortized)
- String intern pool: deduplication of string values

### 3. CPU Profile
Typical CPU breakdown during serialization:
- 40% Reflection-based field access
- 25% Stream I/O and buffer management
- 20% Type lookup and serializer resolution
- 15% Hash computation and reference tracking

### 4. Optimization Techniques

#### Buffer Tuning
Use larger buffers to reduce system calls and reallocations:
- Wrap streams with BufferedOutputStream
- Set initial buffer size based on expected object size
- Pool buffers for repeated serialization operations

#### Custom Serialization
Override writeObject/readObject to avoid reflection:
- Write fields directly using primitive write methods
- Skip unnecessary metadata by implementing Externalizable
- Compress data before writing for large payloads
- Use writeUnshared for objects known to be unique

#### Registration-based Optimization (Kryo/Protobuf)
Pre-register classes to avoid metadata overhead:
- Small registration IDs for frequently serialized classes
- Consistent registration order between serialization and deserialization
- Skip class name storage in output stream

### 5. Comparative Benchmark Results
| Implementation | Throughput (ops/s) | Latency P99 | Size (bytes) |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Java Serialization | 50,000 | 120 us | 200 |
| Kryo | 500,000 | 15 us | 60 |
| Protobuf | 800,000 | 8 us | 40 |
| Jackson JSON | 300,000 | 25 us | 80 |
| JAXB XML | 100,000 | 60 us | 250 |

### 6. Profiling Tools
- JFR (Java Flight Recorder): Monitor serialization events and allocations
- async-profiler: CPU profiling with stack traces
- JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness): Precise throughput/latency measurement
- JOL (Java Object Layout): Memory footprint analysis
- Heap dump analysis: Identify serialization-related memory issues

### 7. Performance Anti-Patterns
- Serializing deeply nested object graphs unnecessarily
- Using default serialization for latency-critical code paths
- Creating new ObjectOutputStream per operation (reuse instead)
- Not buffering stream I/O for large payloads
- Serializing large strings (>64KB) without compression
- Enabling reference tracking when objects are never shared
