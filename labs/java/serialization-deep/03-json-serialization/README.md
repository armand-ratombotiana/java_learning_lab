# JSON Serialization

## Overview
Jackson ObjectMapper, @JsonProperty, @JsonFormat, custom serializer/deserializer, Jackson vs Gson vs JSON-B

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the internal mechanics of JSON Serialization
- Implement working code that demonstrates core concepts
- Analyze performance characteristics and trade-offs
- Apply this knowledge in real-world Java applications

## Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Basic understanding of Java I/O and serialization concepts
- Familiarity with data formats and protocols

## Lab Structure
This micro-lab follows the standard 24-file pedagogical structure with 7 subdirectories for hands-on work.

## Quick Start
1. Navigate to the source directory: src/main/java/com/javalab/03/
2. Review the main implementation class
3. Run tests using: mvn test or gradle test
4. Complete the exercises in EXERCISES.md
5. Build the MINI_PROJECT to cement understanding

### Related Concepts
- Serialization and deserialization fundamentals
- Data interchange formats and protocols
- Schema evolution and versioning
- Performance optimization for data encoding
- Security considerations for untrusted data

### Best Practices
1. Always declare serialVersionUID for Serializable classes
2. Validate input data during deserialization
3. Use appropriate serialization format for your use case
4. Consider schema evolution for long-lived data
5. Profile serialization performance for latency-critical paths
6. Implement custom serialization for complex objects
7. Use readResolve for singleton preservation
8. Prefer JSON/Protobuf for cross-platform communication
9. Avoid Java serialization for new systems if possible
10. Test serialization compatibility across versions

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Missing serialVersionUID declaration
- Deserializing untrusted data without validation
- Using default serialization for complex object graphs
- Ignoring transient field handling
- Not testing backward compatibility
- Mixing different serialization frameworks inconsistently
- Overlooking thread safety in custom writeObject/readObject
- Forgetting to close ObjectOutputStream/ObjectInputStream

### Next Steps
1. Implement custom serialization for a complex domain model
2. Compare performance across different serialization frameworks
3. Design a version-tolerant serialization schema
4. Integrate serialization with a real network protocol
5. Write comprehensive tests covering edge cases
6. Implement a security filter for deserialization
7. Explore alternative serialization approaches (Avro, Thrift)
8. Build a microservice using Protocol Buffers for IPC

### Key Takeaways Summary
- Understand the serialization mechanisms available in Java
- Know the performance characteristics of each format
- Recognize appropriate use cases for different serialization approaches
- Master common patterns and anti-patterns
- Develop debugging intuition for serialization issues
- Build mental models that transfer to other data encoding concepts

### Discussion Questions
1. How would you design a serialization format if starting from scratch?
2. What are the limits of Java serialization in terms of security and performance?
3. How does schema evolution work in different serialization frameworks?
4. What alternatives exist for cross-language data interchange?
5. How would you implement serialization for a high-throughput distributed system?
