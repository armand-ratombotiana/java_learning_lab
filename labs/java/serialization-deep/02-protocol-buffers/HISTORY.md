# Protocol Buffers -- History

## Historical Evolution

### Origins (1995-1997)
Java serialization was introduced in JDK 1.1 as part of the Java platform. It was designed by Sun Microsystems primarily for RMI (Remote Method Invocation). The design was influenced by CORBA's value type serialization.

### JDK 1.2 (1998)
The Externalizable interface was added for custom serialization control. writeReplace and readResolve methods were introduced for the proxy pattern. serialVersionUID became explicitly declarable.

### JDK 5 (2004)
Enhanced enum serialization (serialized by name, not ordinal). Generics added with type erasure considerations for serialization.

### JDK 6-7 (2006-2011)
ObjectStreamField enhancements. Performance improvements in object graph traversal. Better handling of concurrent access.

### JDK 8 (2014)
Lambda serialization support for serializable functional interfaces. Stream API integration.

### JDK 9 (2017)
JEP 290 introduced ObjectInputFilter for deserialization filtering. Major security improvement against deserialization attacks.

### JDK 14+ (2020+)
Records are serializable by default with well-defined behavior. Ongoing discussion about deprecating serialization for removal. JEP 415 added context-specific deserialization filters.

### Modern Era (2020-Present)
Serialization alternatives like Protobuf, Kryo, and JSON have largely replaced Java serialization for new systems. The Java ecosystem continues to emphasize deserialization security. Records provide safer serialization for data carriers.

### Key Milestones
