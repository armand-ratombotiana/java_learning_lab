# XML Serialization -- Architecture

## System Architecture

### High-Level Design
The XML Serialization architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns between the API, serialization engine, type system, and stream I/O layers.

### Architecture Layers

#### 1. API Layer
The API layer provides public entry points for serialization and deserialization operations. It includes:
- Configuration interfaces for customizing serialization behavior
- Annotation processing for type metadata
- Builder/factory methods for constructing serializers
- Error handling and exception types

#### 2. Serialization Engine
The core engine handles object graph traversal and serialization dispatch:
- Depth-first traversal of the object graph
- Reference tracking for shared and circular references
- Strategy-based dispatch to type-specific serializers
- Lifecycle management (initialization, validation, cleanup)
- Buffering and chunking for large object graphs

#### 3. Type System
The type system manages Java type mappings:
- Primitive type handling (int, long, double, etc.)
- Array serialization for primitive and object arrays
- Collection serialization (List, Set, Map)
- Custom type adapters for non-trivial conversions
- Polymorphic type resolution and registration

#### 4. Stream Layer
The stream layer handles raw I/O:
- Buffer management and pooling
- Binary encoding/decoding (varint, fixed-width)
- Stream lifecycle (open, read/write, close)
- Compression and encryption wrappers
- Endianness handling

### Event-Driven Processing
The serialization pipeline follows an event-driven model:
1. Serialization started event
2. Class descriptor written event
3. Object written event
4. Reference written event (for shared objects)
5. Serialization completed event

### Caching Architecture
Performance is improved through strategic caching:
- Class descriptor cache (class -> descriptor mapping)
- Serializer cache (class -> serializer instance)
- String intern cache (reduces duplicate string storage)
- Handle table (object -> handle mapping for reference tracking)
