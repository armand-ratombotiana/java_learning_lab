# Performance Profiling — Mental Models

## Model 1: The Blueprint

Think of Performance Profiling as a blueprint for constructing software. Just as an architect creates blueprints before construction begins, a Java developer designs their system architecture before writing code. The blueprint shows:
- How components fit together
- What each component's responsibilities are
- How data flows through the system

## Model 2: The Toolbox

Performance Profiling provides a toolbox of techniques and patterns. Each tool has a specific purpose:
- **Wrenches** (utility classes): General-purpose tools for common tasks
- **Hammers** (core abstractions): Heavy-duty tools for fundamental operations
- **Measuring tapes** (interfaces): Define precise contracts between parts
- **Levels** (validation): Ensure everything is correctly aligned

## Model 3: The Legal System

Software architecture resembles a legal system:
- **Constitution** (language specification): The fundamental rules everything follows
- **Laws** (APIs): Specific rules for specific situations
- **Contracts** (interfaces): Agreements between different parts of the system
- **Courts** (compiler/runtime): Enforce the rules and resolve disputes

## Model 4: The Orchestra

A well-designed Java application is like an orchestra:
- **Conductor** (main class): Coordinates all parts
- **Sections** (packages/modules): Groups of related instruments
- **Sheet music** (configuration): Tells each section what to play
- **Harmony** (integration): All parts working together smoothly

## Model 5: The City

A large-scale Java application resembles a city:
- **Buildings** (classes): Individual structures with specific purposes
- **Roads** (APIs): Connections between buildings
- **Zoning** (packages): Areas designated for specific types of structures
- **Infrastructure** (frameworks): Roads, utilities, and common services
- **Traffic** (data flow): Movement between buildings

## Applying These Models

When designing with Performance Profiling, ask yourself:
1. What blueprint am I following? (What's the architecture?)
2. Which tool from my toolbox fits this problem?
3. What contracts am I establishing between components?
4. How does this section fit into the overall orchestra?
5. How will traffic (data) flow through my city?
