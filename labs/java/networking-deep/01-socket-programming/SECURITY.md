# Socket Programming -- Security

## Security Considerations

### 1. Network Security Fundamentals
Network applications face numerous security threats including eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, and denial of service. Understanding these threats is essential for building secure networked applications.

### 2. TLS/SSL Encryption
All production network communication should use TLS/SSL encryption:
- Use TLS 1.3 or higher for secure communication
- Configure proper certificate validation
- Implement certificate pinning for critical connections
- Disable weak cipher suites and protocol versions

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- Implement proper authentication before allowing data exchange
- Use token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth2) for stateless services
- Validate client certificates in mutual TLS scenarios
- Implement proper session management

### 4. Input Validation
- Validate all data received from the network
- Check message sizes to prevent buffer overflow attacks
- Validate message format before processing
- Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks

### 5. Denial of Service Protection
- Implement connection rate limiting
- Set appropriate timeout values
- Limit maximum connections per client
- Use backpressure mechanisms
- Implement resource quotas per connection

### 6. Secure Configuration
- Disable weak protocols and cipher suites
- Use secure default configurations
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Follow least privilege principle for network permissions

### 7. Security Checklist
- [ ] TLS/SSL configured for all production connections
- [ ] Certificate validation enabled and tested
- [ ] Input validation on all network data
- [ ] Rate limiting and connection limits configured
- [ ] Timeouts set appropriately
- [ ] Dependencies updated for security patches
- [ ] Network permissions follow least privilege
- [ ] Authentication implemented where needed
- [ ] Audit logging for network events
- [ ] Regular security testing performed
