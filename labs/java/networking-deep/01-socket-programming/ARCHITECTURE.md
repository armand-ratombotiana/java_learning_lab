# Socket Programming -- Architecture
## System Architecture

### High-Level Design
The architecture follows a layered design with clear separation between transport, protocol, and application layers.

### Layer 1: Transport Layer
- Manages TCP/UDP connections
- Handles connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- Provides buffering and flow control

### Layer 2: Protocol Layer
- Message encoding/decoding (framing, serialization)
- Protocol state machines
- Request/response matching

### Layer 3: Application Layer
- Business logic handlers
- Connection event callbacks
- Error handling and recovery

### Threading Model
- Boss threads: accept new connections
- Worker threads: handle I/O events
- Application threads: process business logic

### Design Patterns Used
- Reactor Pattern: event demultiplexing and dispatch
- Proactor Pattern: asynchronous operation completion
- Pipeline Pattern: chain of handlers for message processing
- Factory Pattern: creating connections and handlers
