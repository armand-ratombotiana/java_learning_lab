# HTTP Clients (Java 11+) -- Performance

## Performance Characteristics

### 1. Throughput Metrics
Network application throughput depends on:
- Bandwidth of the network link
- Message size and overhead
- Connection management efficiency
- Protocol overhead (headers, handshakes)

### 2. Latency Components
- Connection establishment time (TCP handshake, TLS negotiation)
- Data transmission time (bandwidth-delay product)
- Processing time (serialization, business logic)
- Queuing time (buffers, thread pools)

### 3. Connection Pooling
Connection pooling significantly improves performance:
- Reduces connection establishment overhead (3-way handshake + TLS)
- Controls resource usage (file descriptors, memory)
- Provides connection reuse for multiple requests
- Enables request pipelining and multiplexing

### 4. Threading Model Impact
- Thread-per-connection: high memory overhead, context switching
- Event loop: efficient for I/O-bound workloads
- Virtual threads (Project Loom): thread-per-request without overhead
- Hybrid: event loop for I/O, thread pool for computation

### 5. Buffer Management
- Direct buffers vs heap buffers for I/O operations
- Buffer pooling reduces allocation overhead
- Proper buffer sizing reduces copying
- Scatter/gather I/O for efficient data handling

### 6. Optimization Techniques
- Use non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
- Implement proper backpressure
- Batch small messages into larger packets
- Use compression for large payloads
- Enable TCP_NODELAY for latency-sensitive applications
- Tune TCP buffer sizes for expected bandwidth-delay product

### 7. Benchmarking Approach
- Measure throughput (requests/second)
- Measure latency percentiles (P50, P99, P999)
- Profile with different concurrency levels
- Compare thread models and buffer strategies
- Test with realistic network conditions
