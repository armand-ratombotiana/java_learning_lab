# NIO Selectors -- Step-by-Step Implementation

## Step 1: Create Project Structure
Create a Maven or Gradle project with the standard directory layout.

## Step 2: Add Dependencies
Add networking libraries (Netty, gRPC, etc.) and test dependencies.

## Step 3: Define the Protocol
Design the message format (length-prefixed, delimited, or using a framework).

## Step 4: Implement the Server
Create the server that accepts connections and processes messages.

## Step 5: Implement the Client
Create the client that connects and sends/receives messages.

## Step 6: Test Round-Trip
Write a test that verifies the client can communicate with the server.

## Step 7: Add Error Handling
Implement proper error handling, timeouts, and reconnection logic.

## Step 8: Performance Tune
Benchmark and optimize buffer sizes, thread pools, and connection handling.

## Step 9: Add Security
Implement TLS/SSL, authentication, and input validation.

## Step 10: Deploy and Monitor
Deploy the application and set up monitoring for connection metrics.
