# gRPC Networking -- Refactoring
## Refactoring Strategies
1. Replace thread-per-connection with thread pool for better resource management
2. Replace blocking I/O with non-blocking NIO for higher concurrency
3. Extract protocol handling from business logic into separate layers
4. Add connection pooling for reusable connections
5. Implement backpressure to prevent consumer overload
6. Add circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
7. Replace custom NIO code with Netty framework for reliability
8. Add TLS encryption to all network communication
9. Implement proper timeout handling for all network operations
10. Add metrics and monitoring for connection lifecycle events
